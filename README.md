# Physics engine

A simple simulation of some particles in space acting under gravity

## Motivation

I've been writing C for years but have less experience in C++ features. I wanted
to learn these, and remembered I did a simple project at uni to simulate objects
under gravity but didn't really understand the coding aspects of it so thought
it would be a good project to learn some C++!

## Features

The first implementation of this will just be two particles interacting with
each other and I'll get them to display on screen. Later implementations will
allow the user to create/remove objects of varying sizes and starting positions.

I want to use and practise:
- Classes
- Passing by reference
- Vectors
- Multithreading


## Instructions
To build and run:
- g++ -c main.cpp classes.cpp
- g++ -o main.exe main.o classes.o
- ./main.exe
